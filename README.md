# dnlib-Metamorphic-code-exemple
Using dnlib to make Metmorphic code in C#

## How does it work ?
It uses ![dnlib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib) to edit a file's byte and run it on memory.

## How to
1. Create "go.txt" in file directory
2. Start the app and see it slowly devouring emptyness of our dark universe
3. When you want to stop it, remove "go.txt" from folder.

## Disclaimer 
C# being an interpreted language and not a compiled language makes true polymorphism impossible. Just4Fun.
